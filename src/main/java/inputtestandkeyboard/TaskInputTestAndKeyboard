    Basic user Input Validation in Java
        we build upon the handling runtime errors video content by using a try and catch block to handle basic user input validation. 
        We show how input from the keybaord through the Java Scanner class can fail if the user enters 
        an incorrect data type and we develop a solution that uses String input, a loop and a try and catch block to solve the problem.

    2-Keyboard 
    Java Keyboard class for User Input Validation
        we build on the code developed in the basic user input validation
        by creating a Keyboard class that provides reusable user input validation routines.
        This makes it very easy to add user input validation to keyboard input in any program.
